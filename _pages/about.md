## amazoneo community

The amazoneo is a social-led blockchain community that emerged in order to develop and consolidate the NEO Smart Economy in the Latin America and the Caribbean. With representatives from diverse countries and regions in a interdisciplinary environment, amazoneo aims to enable a sustainable digital transformation of the territories. 

## Directions for contributing

Donations to the group are managed by [NeoResearch Council](https://github.com/amazoneo/governance) members and can be distributed to contributors according to the following topics of interest (which are also aligned with [NEO Project](https://github.com/neo-project) directions):

- Development and contributions on platforms that provide **Integration** of NEO Ecosystem (integrations between different tools that increase overall user experience and simplify development on NEO);
- Development and contributions on platforms that provide greater **Stability** of NEO Ecosystem (bugfixes and validated/tested proposals for improvement of the main consensus project are also welcome);
- Conducted studies and assessment of state-of-the-art projects, including **Benchmarks** that could lead to platform improved **Efficiency** (projects that propose/test novel high performance tools/techniques also fit this topic);
- Standardization, creation and organization of [Learning Materials](https://github.com/NeoResearch/learning-examples), that could help newcomers to easily develop on NEO (tutorials, written and audiovideo materials, examples and coding templates, specially in different languages...).
