## AmazoNeo community

The AmazoNeo is a social-led blockchain community that emerged in order to develop and consolidate the NEO Smart Economy in Latin America. With representatives from diverse countries and regions in a interdisciplinary environment, amazoneo aims to enable a sustainable digital transformation of the territories.

AmazoNeo is not a private company nor any form of legally constituted entity, we are a network to support the Smart Economy proposed by the [NEO Project](https://github.com/neo-project) in Latin America. Our purpose is to disseminate the use of blockchain technology for social impact in both industry, public sector, academy and civil society.

- establishing comissions with specific context-dependent governance, but shared principles. 
- consolidating a newsletter in with the major advancements of blockchain technology in Latin America with focus on the NEO ecosystem in Portuguese and Spanish. 
- developing monthly reports about the expansion of the network both terms of partnered individuals and organizations.
