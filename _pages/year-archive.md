AmazoNeo founders Vitor Coelho and Alexandre Barbosa provided some informations about the intentions and development of AmazoNeo to the [NNT](https://neonewstoday.com/interviews/amazoneo-community-led-effort-to-grow-neo-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/) (Neo News Today)
We would like to than [Dylan Grabowski](www.twitter.com/grabowskidylan) and the [NNT](www.twitter.com/neonewstoday) team for the support and consolidated partnership.

Furthermore, AmazoNeo community had been mentioned twice in the [NGD](https://github.com/neo-ngd/) (Neo Global Development) monthly report of October. Our role of enforcing the ecosystem in Latin America has been very welcomed, even though in its very beginning.
